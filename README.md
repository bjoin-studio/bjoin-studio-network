## Network Overview

This network serves different work areas through isolated VLANs:
- **Production** - Critical creative workstations and render systems
- **Studio** - General creative work and collaboration spaces  
- **Management** - Servers, storage, and infrastructure systems
- **Workshop** - Development, testing, and experimental work
- **Guest** - Visitor access with restricted permissions

All systems use centralized authentication through FreeIPA, providing single sign-on and consistent security policies across the entire network.
