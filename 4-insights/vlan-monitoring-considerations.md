# VLAN Monitoring Considerations: Similarities and Differences

When establishing monitoring for various VLANs within the network, it's important to understand that while the fundamental monitoring framework remains consistent, the specific focus and metrics will adapt to each VLAN's purpose and sensitivity.

## Similarities in Monitoring Approach

For all monitoring VLANs (e.g., VLAN15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65), the core principles and tools will largely remain the same:

*   **Core Monitoring Categories:** The overarching goals of monitoring—assessing **performance**, ensuring **security**, and verifying **availability**—apply universally.
*   **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):** This protocol will be a primary tool for collecting device health metrics (CPU utilization, memory usage, temperature) and interface-specific performance data (bandwidth utilization, packet errors, discards) from switches, routers, firewalls, and access points.
*   **Syslog:** Centralized syslog collection will be essential for gathering event logs, error messages, and status updates from all network devices. This provides critical insights into operational health and potential issues.
*   **Firewall Logs:** Logs from the OPNsense firewall (or any other firewall in the path) will be crucial for tracking traffic flows, identifying blocked connections, and verifying policy enforcement across all VLANs.
*   **Network Device Uptime:** Monitoring the uptime and reachability of all network infrastructure components (switches, access points, firewalls) is a baseline requirement for any VLAN.

## Key Differences and Tailored Focus

While the tools are similar, *what* you monitor and *how* you interpret the data will differ significantly based on the VLAN's role:

*   **Security Focus:**
    *   **Guest VLANs (e.g., VLAN61, VLAN64 monitored by VLAN65):** The primary security concern is strict isolation from internal networks. Monitoring will heavily focus on firewall deny logs for attempts to access internal resources, and potentially IDS/IPS alerts for suspicious activity originating from guest clients.
    *   **Internal/Production VLANs (e.g., VLAN11 Production, monitored by VLAN15):** Security monitoring shifts to detecting unauthorized access *between* internal segments, identifying compromised internal hosts, and monitoring for data exfiltration. More granular access control list (ACL) logging and internal traffic analysis become critical.
*   **Performance Metrics:**
    *   **Guest VLANs:** Bandwidth utilization (especially internet egress), number of connected clients, and DHCP lease statistics are key.
    *   **Internal/Production VLANs:** Focus expands to include application-specific performance metrics, database connection counts, storage I/O, server CPU/memory utilization, and latency between critical application components.
*   **Alerting Thresholds:**
    *   What constitutes an "alert" will vary. A high number of DHCP requests might be normal on a guest network but indicative of an issue on a static internal network.
    *   Bandwidth saturation on a guest network might be acceptable, while the same level on a production network could indicate a critical performance bottleneck.
*   **Traffic Patterns:**
    *   Guest VLANs typically exhibit more varied and unpredictable traffic patterns, primarily outbound to the internet.
    *   Internal VLANs often have more predictable, application-specific traffic flows (e.g., client-server communication, database queries, backup traffic).
*   **Compliance and Auditing:** Internal and production VLANs often have stricter compliance requirements, necessitating more detailed logging and auditing of access and changes.

In summary, while the underlying monitoring infrastructure can be shared, the configuration of monitoring agents, the specific metrics collected, the thresholds for alerts, and the interpretation of security events must be carefully tailored to the unique function and risk profile of each VLAN.
