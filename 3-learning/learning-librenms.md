# Understanding LibreNMS

**LibreNMS** is a powerful, open-source, and feature-rich network monitoring system that provides a wealth of information about your network infrastructure. It is a community-driven fork of Observium and is under active development. LibreNMS uses the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to poll a wide range of network devices, servers, and other equipment, and it presents the collected data in a user-friendly web interface.

## Key Features of LibreNMS

LibreNMS offers a comprehensive set of features that make it a popular choice for network monitoring:

*   **Automatic Discovery:** It can automatically discover devices on your network using protocols like SNMP, CDP, FDP, LLDP, and OSPF. This feature simplifies the process of adding new devices to the monitoring system.
*   **Extensive Device Support:** LibreNMS supports a vast array of network hardware and operating systems out of the box, including Cisco, Juniper, Brocade, Linux, Windows, and many more. This broad support ensures that you can monitor a diverse range of devices in your network.
*   **Flexible Alerting System:** It includes a highly flexible alerting system that can notify you of issues via various methods, such as email, Slack, Telegram, and more. You can create custom alert rules based on specific thresholds or device states.
*   **Powerful Graphing:** LibreNMS provides detailed and customizable graphs for all collected metrics. This allows you to visualize performance data, identify trends, and troubleshoot issues effectively.
*   **Distributed Polling:** For large networks, LibreNMS supports distributed polling, which allows you to scale the monitoring system by distributing the polling load across multiple servers.

## How LibreNMS Works

LibreNMS is typically installed on a dedicated Linux server. Once installed, you can add your network devices by providing their IP addresses and SNMP credentials. LibreNMS will then start polling these devices at regular intervals to collect data on various metrics, such as CPU usage, memory utilization, bandwidth, and more. All the collected data is stored in a time-series database, which allows for historical analysis and trending.

The web-based interface provides a central dashboard for viewing the status of your network, drilling down into individual devices, and configuring alerts. You can also access detailed graphs, reports, and inventory information for all your monitored devices.

## Common Use Cases

LibreNMS is a versatile tool that can be used for a variety of network management tasks, including:

*   **Proactive Monitoring:** Keep an eye on the health and performance of your network devices to identify potential issues before they impact users.
*   **Bandwidth Monitoring:** Track bandwidth usage on your network links to identify bottlenecks and plan for capacity upgrades.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Quickly diagnose network problems by analyzing performance data and event logs.
*   **Inventory Management:** Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all your network devices and their configurations.
