Block storage is a type of data storage that stores data in fixed-size blocks, each with a unique address. These blocks are treated as individual hard drives and are presented to the operating system as raw, unformatted volumes. This low-level access to data makes block storage highly efficient and flexible, as the operating system has direct control over how data is organized and accessed within each block. It is the most common form of storage used by servers and personal computers, forming the foundation for file systems, databases, and operating system installations. Block storage is typically accessed via protocols like Fibre Channel (FC), iSCSI, or NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF), which provide high-speed, low-latency connections between servers and storage devices.

One of the primary advantages of block storage is its performance. Because data is accessed at a granular, block level, it offers very low latency and high throughput, making it ideal for performance-intensive applications such as transactional databases, virtual machines, and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads. The operating system can format the raw block volumes with any desired file system (e.g., NTFS, ext4, XFS), giving administrators complete control over data organization and optimization. This flexibility also extends to data management, as block volumes can be easily partitioned, resized, and replicated, providing a robust foundation for dynamic storage environments.

Block storage is commonly deployed in Storage Area Networks (SANs) or as direct-attached storage (DAS) to individual servers. In cloud environments, block storage is often offered as a service (e.g., Amazon EBS, Google Persistent Disk), allowing users to provision virtual disks that can be attached to virtual machines. While highly performant and flexible, block storage typically requires more complex management compared to file or object storage, as it lacks built-in file system capabilities and requires the operating system to manage data organization. However, for applications demanding the highest levels of performance, control, and direct access to raw storage, block storage remains the indispensable choice.
