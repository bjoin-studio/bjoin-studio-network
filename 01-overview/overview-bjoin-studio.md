## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the bjoin.studio network. It details the design of the new network, the reasons for the redesign, and the plan for its implementation. This document is intended to be a living document that will be updated as the network evolves.

## Analysis of Existing Infrastructure

The previous network infrastructure at bjoin.studio was a collection of disparate components that had grown organically over time. This resulted in a network that was difficult to manage, insecure, and unable to keep up with the studio's growing needs. The network was a flat, single-VLAN network, which meant that there was no separation of traffic between different devices and services. This posed a significant security risk, as a compromise of any single device could potentially compromise the entire network. The network was also difficult to manage, as there was no central point of control for network services. This made it difficult to troubleshoot problems and to make changes to the network.

## High-Level Plan

The new network is designed to address the shortcomings of the previous network. The new network is a complete overhaul of the studio's digital infrastructure, designed to meet the demands of a modern, data-intensive creative environment. The new network is a cohesive and centrally managed system that is built on a foundation of modern networking principles.

The high-level plan for the new network is as follows:
- **Core Network:** A 100GbE core network will be implemented to provide high-speed connectivity between all network devices.
- **VLANs:** The network will be segmented into a number of VLANs to isolate different types of traffic and to provide a high level of security.
- **Centralized Management:** The network will be centrally managed using a combination of OPNsense and FreeIPA, which will provide a single point of control for all network services.
- **Security:** The network will be secured using a combination of firewalls, access control lists, and intrusion detection and prevention systems.

## New Network Design

The new bjoin.studio network is a complete overhaul of the studio's digital infrastructure, designed to meet the demands of a modern, data-intensive creative environment. The previous network was a collection of disparate components that had grown organically over time. This resulted in a network that was difficult to manage, insecure, and unable to keep up with the studio's growing needs. The new network, on the other hand, is a cohesive and centrally managed system that is built on a foundation of modern networking principles.

The new network is designed to be highly available, scalable, and secure. It is built around a 100GbE core, with a combination of 10GbE and 1GbE access switches to provide connectivity for a wide range of devices. The network is segmented into a number of VLANs, which are used to isolate different types of traffic and to provide a high level of security. The network is also centrally managed using a combination of OPNsense and FreeIPA, which provide a single point of control for all network services.

The new network is a critical component of the studio's digital infrastructure. It provides the foundation for all of the studio's creative and business operations, and it is essential for the studio's continued success. The new network is a significant investment, but it is one that will pay dividends for years to come.
