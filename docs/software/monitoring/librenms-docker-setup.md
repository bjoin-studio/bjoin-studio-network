# LibreNMS Docker Setup Guide

This document outlines the steps to get LibreNMS running using Docker Compose.

## 1. Files Created

Two files have been created in the `/home/bjoin-studio/workspace/GitHub/bjoin-studio-network/docker/librenms/` directory:

*   `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the LibreNMS services (web, database, memcached, redis, snmpd, cron).
*   `.env`: Contains environment variables for database credentials. **You MUST edit this file to set strong, unique passwords.**

## 2. Important: Update Passwords in `.env`

Before starting LibreNMS, you **must** edit the `.env` file and replace `your_db_password_here` and `your_db_root_password_here` with strong, unique passwords.

```bash
nano /home/bjoin-studio/workspace/GitHub/bjoin-studio-network/docker/librenms/.env
```

## 3. Start LibreNMS

Navigate to the `librenms-docker` directory and start the containers:

```bash
cd /home/bjoin-studio/workspace/GitHub/bjoin-studio-network/docker/librenms
docker compose up -d
```

This command will:
*   Download the necessary Docker images (LibreNMS, MariaDB, Memcached, Redis).
*   Create and start the containers in detached mode (in the background).

## 4. Access LibreNMS Web Interface

Once the containers are running (this might take a few minutes for the first boot), you can access the LibreNMS web interface in your browser:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

(If you changed the port in `docker-compose.yml`, use your chosen port instead of `8000`.)

## 5. Initial Setup in Web Interface

Follow the on-screen instructions in the LibreNMS web interface to complete the initial setup, which typically includes:

*   Database migration.
*   Creating an admin user.

## 6. Next Steps

After the initial setup, you can begin adding devices to LibreNMS for monitoring.

**Note:** The `APP_KEY` in the `.env` file will be automatically generated by LibreNMS on its first run. You don't need to set it manually unless you are restoring from a backup.
