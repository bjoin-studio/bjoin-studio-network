# Credential Management Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for managing credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information within the bjoin.studio network environment.

## 1. Never Hardcode Credentials

*   **Principle:** Sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and private keys should *never* be directly written into source code, configuration files, or scripts that are committed to version control (e.g., Git).
*   **Risk:** Hardcoding credentials makes them easily discoverable by anyone with access to the repository, posing a significant security risk.

## 2. Use Environment Variables for Local Development

*   **Purpose:** For local development and testing, environment variables are a common and convenient way to manage configuration.
*   **Implementation:** Use `.env` files (e.g., `config/.env`) to store key-value pairs for environment variables.
*   **Security:**
    *   **Crucial:** Always add `.env` files to your `.gitignore` file to prevent them from being accidentally committed to your repository.
    *   Load these variables into your application at runtime.

## 3. Implement Dedicated Secrets Management Tools for Production

For production environments and multi-server deployments, more robust and secure solutions are required:

*   **Ansible Vault:**
    *   **Use Case:** Ideal for encrypting sensitive data (passwords, API keys, private keys) within Ansible playbooks, roles, and variables.
    *   **Benefit:** Allows you to safely store encrypted secrets in your version control system. Secrets are decrypted only at runtime when Ansible is executed with the appropriate vault password.
*   **HashiCorp Vault:**
    *   **Use Case:** A comprehensive solution for securely storing, accessing, and managing secrets across various applications and infrastructure.
    *   **Features:** Offers dynamic secrets, data encryption, auditing, and fine-grained access control.
*   **Cloud-Specific Secret Managers:**
    *   **Use Case:** If deploying to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), leverage their native secret management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager).
    *   **Features:** Integrates seamlessly with cloud services, providing secure storage, rotation, and access control for secrets.
*   **Docker Secrets / Kubernetes Secrets:**
    *   **Use Case:** For containerized applications deployed with Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, these built-in features provide a secure way to manage and inject secrets into containers.
    *   **Benefit:** Secrets are not stored in plain text in container images or configuration files.

## 4. Adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege

*   **Principle:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users, services, or applications accessing sensitive data or performing specific tasks.
*   **Example:** For monitoring exporters (like the FreeIPA exporter), create dedicated read-only users with just enough privileges to collect the required metrics, rather than using administrative accounts.

## 5. Ensure Secure Communication (HTTPS/TLS)

*   **Principle:** Always use encrypted communication (HTTPS/TLS) when transmitting credentials or sensitive data over the network.
*   **Avoid Insecure Options:** Flags like `--insecure-skip-verify` (seen in some initial setup guides) should be strictly avoided in production environments. Properly configure SSL/TLS certificates for all services.

By following these best practices, you can significantly enhance the security posture of your network and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
