Absolutely‚Äîthanks for the detailed breakdown. That context really sharpens the picture üé¨. Here's a refined table that reflects your studio's structure and the purpose of each FreeIPA group, aligned with your VLANs:

### üõ†Ô∏è Additional Suggestions

- **Nested Groups**: You could create role-based groups like `creatives`, `technicians`, `executives`, and nest them inside domain-specific groups for easier policy management.
- **HBAC Rules**: Use Host-Based Access Control to restrict SSH or service access based on group membership.
- **Sudo Rules**: Assign elevated privileges only to `management` or specific technical roles.
- **Automation**: Consider scripting group assignments during onboarding to streamline user provisioning.

This setup gives you a **modular, scalable, and intuitive** access control model that mirrors your physical and operational layout. If you ever want to layer in MFA, VPN access, or service-specific permissions, this foundation will support it beautifully.
