# Repository Insights

Based on the content of the `bjoin_studio` documents, I've gathered the following insights about the purpose of this repository:

This repository is the **central planning and design hub for the network architecture of a creative organization named "bjoin.studio."** It's not just a collection of static files, but a detailed, evolving workspace that documents the network from initial concept to a comprehensive, implementation-ready plan.

Here are the key takeaways:

*   **Purpose-Built for a Creative Studio:** The entire network is designed to support a high-demand creative workflow. This is clear from the specialized "zones" like **Studio**, **Stage**, **Production**, and **Workshop**, each with its own set of VLANs tailored for specific tasks like media editing, tethered camera capture, and rendering.

*   **Iterative and Evolving Design:** The presence of multiple versions (`v01`, `v02`, `blueprint`, `design`) shows a clear, iterative design process. The architecture has evolved over time, with changes to the IP addressing scheme (from `10.10.x.x` to `10.101.x.x` and `10.20.x.x`), increasing detail in the documentation, and the refinement of security policies.

*   **Focus on Security and Segmentation:** A core principle of the design is strict network segmentation using VLANs. This is done to isolate different functional areas, control traffic flow with a central firewall, and enhance security. The documents detail specific access rules, firewall policies, and even the use of a dedicated management VLAN.

*   **From High-Level Design to Detailed Implementation:** The documents progress from high-level concepts (like the purpose of each VLAN) to extremely detailed, actionable plans. This includes:
    *   Specific hardware choices (Protectli for the firewall, Cisco, Sodola, and Netgear for switches).
    *   VLAN-to-subnet mapping and DHCP scope definitions.
    *   Step-by-step guides for configuring the OPNsense firewall.
    *   Plans for deploying a FreeIPA server for identity management, including the exact installation commands.

*   **Comprehensive Technical Scope:** The repository covers a wide range of network engineering topics, including:
    *   Layer 2 and Layer 3 architecture.
    *   VLANs and trunking.
    *   Firewalling and NAT.
    *   VPN for remote and site-to-site access.
    *   DNS and DHCP.
    *   Identity and Access Management (IAM) with FreeIPA.

In essence, this repository serves as the "single source of truth" for the bjoin.studio network, guiding its implementation, management, and future growth.
