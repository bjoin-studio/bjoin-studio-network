üîç Use Case Summary
Switch Model	Role in Network	Port Type	Management	Ideal For
Cisco Nexus 9236C	Core/Spine Switch	QSFP28 (100G)	Layer 3	Data center, backbone routing
Sodola 8-Port 10G	Aggregation/Edge	SFP+ (10G)	Web	Homelab, small enterprise

Netgear ProSafe GS105	Basic Connectivity	RJ45 (1G)	Unmanaged	Small office, low traffic


You're thinking in the right direction‚Äîlayering your switches from basic to enterprise-grade is a smart way to build out a test environment. Let‚Äôs walk through how to set up your test router and how to assign IP and DHCP settings based on your topology.
üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Network Topology
[Router]
   ‚Üì
[Netgear GS105] ‚Äî basic unmanaged switch
   ‚Üì
[BitEngine SW08XM] ‚Äî 10G RJ45 switch
   ‚Üì
[Sodola 8-Port 10G] ‚Äî 10G SFP+ switch
   ‚Üì
[Cisco Nexus 9236C] ‚Äî core L3 switch
This setup lets you:
Use the Netgear for basic devices or initial uplink
Use BitEngine for high-speed copper connections (e.g., desktops, NAS)
Use Sodola for fiber/SFP+ aggregation
Use Cisco Nexus for VLAN routing, ACLs, and backbone traffic
üåê Router Setup
üîπ IP Addressing
Let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre testing in the Workshop VLAN (VLAN 10), which uses:
Subnet: 10.20.0.0/24
Gateway: 10.20.0.1
So your router should be:
LAN IP: 10.20.0.1
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
DHCP Range: 10.20.0.100 ‚Äì 10.20.0.200 (or adjust as needed)
üîπ DHCP Settings
Start IP: 10.20.0.100
End IP: 10.20.0.200
Lease Time: 24 hours (or shorter for testing)
DNS Server: You can use 10.20.250.10 if you have an internal DNS, or fallback to 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)
üß† Pro Tips
Router Placement: If your router supports VLAN tagging and routing, you could eventually move it closer to the Cisco Nexus for more control.
Static IPs: Reserve static IPs for switches and servers outside the DHCP range (e.g., 10.20.0.2 ‚Äì 10.20.0.50)
Testing: Start with ping tests between devices on the Netgear and BitEngine to confirm connectivity before layering in VLANs and ACLs.
Want help generating a config snippet for your router or a visual of this topology? I can whip that up next.











üß† Router Setup Strategy
Your router will act as the default gateway for each VLAN. That means:
It needs a virtual interface (SVI) or sub-interface for each VLAN
Each interface gets the .1 IP in its subnet
DHCP ranges should avoid .1 (gateway) and leave room for static IPs

# üîß Additional Router Config Tips

- Enable VLAN tagging on router interfaces if using trunk ports
- Set up DHCP relay if your router doesn‚Äôt serve DHCP directly
- Use ACLs or firewall rules to enforce visibility restrictions  
  _(e.g., block VLAN 10 from accessing VLAN 32)_
- DNS: Point clients to internal DNS (e.g., `10.20.250.10`) or external fallback (`8.8.8.8`)



üîπ Software
OPNsense Installer ISO
Rufus or similar tool to create bootable USB
üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup Guide
1. Download & Prepare Installer
Go to OPNsense Downloads
Choose AMD64 architecture, VGA image (unless using serial console)
Use Rufus to write the ISO to your USB stick
2. Install OPNsense on the Vault
Plug in USB, monitor, and keyboard
Boot into USB and follow the installer prompts
Choose ZFS or UFS file system (ZFS recommended for reliability)
Assign interfaces:
WAN ‚Üí connected to your upstream router (Netgear or modem)
LAN ‚Üí connected to your internal switch (Netgear GS105 or others)
3. Initial Configuration
Access OPNsense via browser: https://192.168.1.1
Default credentials: admin / opnsense
Change password immediately
Set LAN IP to match your VLAN 10 gateway: 10.20.0.1
üåê VLAN Setup
Example: Create VLAN 10 (Workshop)
Go to Interfaces > Other Types > VLAN
Add VLAN:
Parent Interface: LAN NIC
VLAN Tag: 10
Description: Workshop
Go to Interfaces > Assignments
Add new VLAN interface
Enable it and set static IP: 10.20.0.1/24
Repeat for VLANs 20‚Äì42 as needed.
üß© DHCP Setup
Go to Services > DHCPv4
Select VLAN 10 interface
Enable DHCP server
Set range: 10.20.0.100 ‚Äì 10.20.0.200
Repeat for each VLAN.
üîê Firewall Rules
Go to Firewall > Rules
Select each VLAN interface
Add rules to allow or block traffic based on your visibility matrix
Example: Block VLAN 10 from accessing VLAN 32
üõ°Ô∏è VPN Setup (Optional for Later)
Use WireGuard or OpenVPN plugin
Assign VPN subnet: 10.20.250.0/24
Create firewall rules to restrict access to Studio/Production 1Gb only
Would you like help generating the exact VLAN and firewall rule config for your studio layout? I can build a tailored config plan for OPNsense.


üß≠ Your Setup Goals
Netgear R6220 acts like your ISP router:
Provides DHCP in 192.168.1.0/24
Does NAT and WiFi
Protectli Vault (OPNsense) connects via WAN port to Netgear LAN
Gets IP from Netgear (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
Governs internal VLANs, VPNs, and studio traffic
OPNsense LAN side uses your custom subnet (e.g., 10.20.0.0/24)
Serves DHCP to studio devices
Routes between VLANs
Hosts VPNs
üîå Physical Connections
[Production Cable Modem]
      ‚Üì
[Netgear R6220] ‚Äî 192.168.1.1
      ‚Üì
[Protectli Vault WAN port] ‚Üê gets IP like 192.168.1.100
      ‚Üì
[Protectli Vault LAN port] ‚Üí connects to studio switches
      ‚Üì
[Studio Devices] ‚Äî get IPs like 10.20.0.x
‚öôÔ∏è IP & DHCP Configuration
üîπ Netgear R6220
LAN IP: 192.168.1.1
DHCP Range: 192.168.1.100 ‚Äì 192.168.1.200
WAN Port: Connected to cable modem
LAN Port: Connected to Protectli WAN
üîπ Protectli Vault (OPNsense)
WAN IP: Receives 192.168.1.x from Netgear
LAN IP: Set to 10.20.0.1
DHCP Range: 10.20.0.100 ‚Äì 10.20.0.200
VPN Subnet: 10.20.250.0/24 (for remote access)
üîê VPN & VLAN Strategy
OPNsense governs internal VLANs (e.g., Workshop, Stage, Studio, Production)
VPN clients connect to OPNsense and get IPs in 10.20.250.0/24
OPNsense routes traffic between VLANs based on your visibility rules
Netgear just provides internet access to OPNsense via WAN
üß† Why This Works
You‚Äôre emulating your ISP router with the Netgear R6220
OPNsense becomes your internal network controller
You avoid double NAT issues because OPNsense is behind Netgear, and you‚Äôre not exposing it externally yet
Would you like help setting up OPNsense interfaces and VPN configuration next? I can walk you through assigning VLANs and building firewall rules.
