# üîß Additional Router Config Tips

- Enable VLAN tagging on router interfaces if using trunk ports
- Set up DHCP relay if your router doesn‚Äôt serve DHCP directly
- Use ACLs or firewall rules to enforce visibility restrictions  
  _(e.g., block VLAN 10 from accessing VLAN 32)_
- DNS: Point clients to internal DNS (e.g., `10.20.250.10`) or external fallback (`8.8.8.8`)


# Network Architecture for bjoin.studio

This document outlines the internal network architecture for **bjoin.studio**, the digital infrastructure supporting **Bjoin Films Photography Studio**. The design prioritizes performance, segmentation, and scalability across multiple creative departments.

## Current ISP & Gateway

- **ISP**: Charter Spectrum (ADSL)
- **Primary Gateway**: Netgear 6220 (temporary substitute for real internet)
- **Router NAT Range**: `192.168.1.0/24`
- **Protectli FW4B-0-8-120** running **OPNsense 25.7** is used for VLAN, routing, and firewall management.

## Protectli Port Assignments

| Port  | Role        | Notes                                                                 |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WAN   | Internet    | Connected to Netgear 6220, receives `192.168.1.254/24` via DHCP       |
| LAN   | Core VLAN   | Currently set to `10.20.0.1/24` (likely default or placeholder subnet)|
| OPT1  | Unused      | Reserved for future VLAN trunking or DMZ                              |
| OPT2  | Unused      | Reserved for high-speed uplink or isolated services                   |

## VLAN Design

The network is segmented by department and bandwidth requirements. Each VLAN has its own subnet, router IP, and DHCP range.

| VLAN | Environment     | Subnet           | Router IP     | DHCP Range                  |

## Recommendations & Improvements

### üîß VLAN Optimization
- **Collapse bandwidth tiers** where possible. For example, Stage and Studio could share VLANs with QoS rules if physical separation isn't critical.
- **Use VLAN tagging** across switches to reduce port usage and improve scalability.

### üîê Security Enhancements
- **Isolate VLANs** with strict firewall rules in OPNsense.
- **Enable IDS/IPS** on OPNsense for Studio and Production VLANs.
- **Use VLAN 999** or similar as a "black hole" for unused ports.

### üì° WiFi Strategy
- Deploy **dedicated access points** per environment with VLAN tagging.
- Use **WPA3** and **RADIUS authentication** for Studio and Production WiFi.

### üìà Performance Planning
- Use **LACP (Link Aggregation)** on OPT ports for trunking to core switches.
- Consider **10Gb/100Gb switches** with SFP+ or QSFP28 uplinks for Studio and Production.

### üß† Management & Monitoring
- Deploy **NetFlow or sFlow** for traffic analysis.
- Use **Zabbix, Prometheus, or LibreNMS** for network health monitoring.

## Next Steps

- Finalize VLAN assignments and firewall rules in OPNsense
- Configure OPT1/OPT2 for trunking or uplinks
- Deploy managed switches with VLAN support
- Set up WiFi access points with VLAN tagging
- Document physical topology and cable maps
