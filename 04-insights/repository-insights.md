# Repository Insights

Based on the content of the `bjoin_studio` documents, I've gathered the following insights about the purpose of this repository:

This repository is the **central planning and design hub for the network architecture of a creative organization named "bjoin.studio."** It's not just a collection of static files, but a detailed, evolving workspace that documents the network from initial concept to a comprehensive, implementation-ready plan.

Here are the key takeaways:

*   **Purpose-Built for a Creative Studio:** The entire network is designed to support a high-demand creative workflow. This is clear from the specialized "zones" like **Studio**, **Stage**, **Production**, and **Workshop**, each with its own set of VLANs tailored for specific tasks like media editing, tethered camera capture, and rendering.

*   **Iterative and Evolving Design:** The presence of multiple versions (`v01`, `v02`, `blueprint`, `design`) shows a clear, iterative design process. The architecture has evolved over time, with changes to the IP addressing scheme (from `10.10.x.x` to `10.101.x.x` and `10.20.x.x`), increasing detail in the documentation, and the refinement of security policies.

*   **Focus on Security and Segmentation:** A core principle of the design is strict network segmentation using VLANs. This is done to isolate different functional areas, control traffic flow with a central firewall, and enhance security. The documents detail specific access rules, firewall policies, and even the use of a dedicated management VLAN.

*   **From High-Level Design to Detailed Implementation:** The documents progress from high-level concepts (like the purpose of each VLAN) to extremely detailed, actionable plans. This includes:
    *   Specific hardware choices (Protectli for the firewall, Cisco, Sodola, and Netgear for switches).
    *   VLAN-to-subnet mapping and DHCP scope definitions.
    *   Step-by-step guides for configuring the OPNsense firewall.
    *   Plans for deploying a FreeIPA server for identity management, including the exact installation commands.

*   **Comprehensive Technical Scope:** The repository covers a wide range of network engineering topics, including:
    *   Layer 2 and Layer 3 architecture.
    *   VLANs and trunking.
    *   Firewalling and NAT.
    *   VPN for remote and site-to-site access.
    *   DNS and DHCP.
    *   Identity and Access Management (IAM) with FreeIPA.

In essence, this repository serves as the "single source of truth" for the bjoin.studio network, guiding its implementation, management, and future growth.

## Recent Progress and Key Achievements (August 2025)

This section summarizes the significant progress made in documenting and planning the bjoin.studio network infrastructure.

### 1. Core Infrastructure Documentation & Refinement

*   **Proxmox VE Host Setup (`pmx-01`):**
    *   Detailed installation and network configuration guide (`proxmox-host-setup-guide.md`) updated to reflect correct physical interface names (`enp11s0`, `enp12s0`) and the full set of intended VLAN bridges (11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61).
    *   Troubleshooting insights from real-world console access and network configuration issues were documented.
    *   A robust command-line script (`pmx-01-network-config-commands.md`) was created for applying network configurations, addressing previous copy-paste issues.
    *   A runbook for Proxmox host configuration backup (`proxmox-host-backup.md`) was added.

*   **FreeIPA Server Setup (`ipa-01`):**
    *   Comprehensive runbook (`freeipa-server-setup-guide.md`) detailing VM creation, OS installation, FreeIPA server installation, and critical network integration (VLANs, firewall rules).
    *   Advanced FreeIPA integration concepts (client enrollment, Sudo rules, HBAC, service integration) were added to the runbook.
    *   A runbook for FreeIPA user and group management (`freeipa-user-group-management.md`) was created, establishing naming conventions and command examples.
    *   The FreeIPA server setup script (`setup-freeipa-server.py`) was qualified, updated with versioning, and modified to include placeholder arguments for non-interactive password input.

*   **Netgear GS108Ev4 Switch Configuration:**
    *   A design document (`netgear-gs108ev4-port-config.md`) was created outlining the intended port configuration for this access layer switch.
    *   It was determined that direct Ansible automation via CLI is not feasible for this specific switch model/firmware.
    *   A detailed manual configuration runbook (`netgear-gs108ev4-manual-vlan-config.md`) was created, providing step-by-step instructions for web GUI configuration of VLANs and ports, accurately reflecting the switch's current operational state.

### 2. Network Design & Optimization Insights

*   **Hybrid Routing Strategy:** A new design document (`network-device-role-optimization.md`) was created to articulate the hybrid routing strategy, leveraging OPNsense for security-critical routing and the Cisco Nexus 9236C for high-speed inter-VLAN routing.
*   **Seamless Cross-VLAN Access:** The `README.md` was updated with an insight section explaining how the network design enables seamless cross-VLAN access for users via FreeIPA, mediated by the firewall.

### 3. Core Network Device Integration

*   **Cisco Nexus 9236C Core Switch:**
    *   Successfully established console access and performed initial setup (hostname, management IP, SSH enablement).
    *   Troubleshot and resolved POAP (Power On Auto Provisioning) prompts and SSH key generation errors.
    *   **Successfully established a high-speed 40Gbps Link Aggregation Group (LAG) / Port-Channel between the Cisco Nexus 9236C and the Sodola KT-NOS SL-SWTGW2C8F switch.** This involved:
        *   Identifying and configuring the correct QSFP28 port on the Nexus.
        *   Configuring breakout mode on the Nexus to split the QSFP port into four 10Gb interfaces.
        *   Adding the breakout interfaces to a Port-Channel on the Nexus.
        *   Configuring the corresponding LAG on the Sodola switch (including physical port assignment, LAG creation, and trunk configuration).
        *   Extensive troubleshooting of physical link issues (cable seating, transceiver detection) and configuration discrepancies between CLI and GUI.
    *   A functional configuration file (`n9k-01_functional-config.cfg`) was generated for the Nexus, incorporating VLANs, SVIs for Layer 3 routing, and the Port-Channel configuration.

### 4. Repository Management

*   All new and modified documentation and scripts have been consistently version-controlled, staged, committed, and pushed to the repository, ensuring a reliable fallback mechanism.
*   The repository structure was refined for better clarity and organization.
